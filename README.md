# tapunio-reloaded-v0.3-enclosure
3D printable case for [arananet's Tapunio Reloaded](https://github.com/arananet/Tapuino-Reloaded) v0.3 PCB.  Since all I had was the Gerber files for the PCB, I used Gerbview in Kicad 6 to create a new PCB and then added a few footprints for the key components to create a STEP file to model around in [DesignSpark Mechanical](https://www.rs-online.com/designspark/home). The OLED screen used in the "old" style 0.96" one you find on AliExpress with the oval M2 mounting holes.
